I am a Master of Data Science student at the University of British Columbia with a strong interest in artificial intelligence and data science applications. I am particularly interested in how data-driven methods can be used to support decision making across domains such as finance, healthcare, and technology. Through this blog, I share explanations, personal experiences, and reflections on data science concepts, models, and real-world applications as I continue developing my skills in the field.
